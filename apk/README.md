A simple Android app that runs Deadnet directly on Android devices. </br> </br>

The APK is stored inside [bin](https://github.com/flashnuke/deadnet/tree/main/apk/bin) directory, but can be built manually as well.
</br>The attack is written in C++ and compiled into native binaries that are run explicitly by the Python app (see the `Notes.Permissions` section for more). </br>

# Requirements
* Device must be rooted.
* Most modern devices are ARM64. The native binaries are compiled for the following machine architecture types: (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86_64), see the building section in order to compile for a different architecture type.

# Usage
* Grant permissions.
* Use the buttons - `Start`, `Stop` and `Refresh` (to refresh the current wifi connection info).
* In case of an error, use the `Debug Logs` button to fetch the logs, and feel free to open an issue for me! I will be happy to understand what went wrong.

### Permissions
* Some parts were compiled into native binaries due to lack of permissions to open raw sockets by the Python interpreter on Android (even when root).
* `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission is requested in order to access the SSID (wifi network name).

# Building manually
Steps to build the app manually. </br>
The following tools are required:
* Buildozer and Kivy library
* NDK tools

### Cloning the library
```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/flashnuke/deadnet.git
```

### Compiling the C++ Binaries
The C++ binaries source code files (`src/arp.cpp` for the ARP poisoning and `src/nra.cpp` for the dead router attack) should be compiled by NDK:
```bash
cd /tmp  # DO NOT CLONE NDK INTO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY! it will mess with the build process
mkdir android-ndk && cd android-ndk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r26d-linux.zip
unzip android-ndk-r26d-linux.zip
export NDK_PATH=$(pwd)/android-ndk-r26d # NDK_PATH example: "NDK_PATH=/tmp/my-android-toolchain"

# compile binaries
cd <path_to_deadnet_root>/apk
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.arm64 src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.arm src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.x86 src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.x86_64 src/nra.cpp

$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.arm64 src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.arm src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.x86 src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.x86_64 src/arp.cpp
```

The compiled binaries will be stored under `./assets`.

### Building the APK
```bash
# navigate to the apk directory
cd <path_to_deadnet_root>/apk

# make sure you have python 3.10 installed
python3.10 --version
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install buildozer - refer to ths official for more https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

# build the apk 
buildozer android debug # build in debug mode
```
The compiled APK will be stored under `./bin`.

# Debugging
### Debug Logs
Quick debugging can be done using the `Debug Logs` button, which will display useful logs. </br>
### ADB logcat
If a more thorough debug process is needed, `adb` is the right for that. </br>
Connecting the device to ADB and running `adb logcat` would show all the logs, which can be filtered further by using `adb logcat | grep -E 'python|DeadNet'`.
