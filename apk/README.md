# Deadnet APK
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/flashnuke/deadnet/assets/59119926/fbb72f10-764c-4272-aa8c-8623f34b8ba2" width="350" ></p>
A simple GUI that runs Deadnet directly on Android devices. </br> </br>

The APK is stored inside [bin](https://github.com/flashnuke/deadnet/tree/main/apk/bin) directory, but it can be built manually as well.
</br>The code that is supposed to open network sockets and send the spoofed packets is written in C++ and compiled into native binaries that are run explicitly by the Python app.

# Requirements
* Device must be rooted
* Most modern devices are ARM64. The native binaries are compiled for the following machine architecture types: (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86_64), see the building section in order to compile for a different architecture type and modify the code accordingly


# Building
Steps to build the app manually. </br>
The following tools are required:
* NDK tools
* Buildozer and Kivy library

### Compiling the C++ Binaries
The C++ binaries source code files (`src/arp.cpp` for the ARP poisoning and `src/nra.cpp` for the dead router attack) should be compiled by NDK:
```bash
# after cloning


mkdir android-ndk && cd android-ndk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r26d-linux.zip
unzip android-ndk-r26d-linux.zip
export NDK_PATH=$(pwd)/android-ndk-r26d


# compile binaries
cd <path_to_deadnet_root>/apk
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.arm64 src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.arm src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.x86 src/nra.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/nra.x86_64 src/nra.cpp

$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.arm64 src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.arm src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/i686-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.x86 src/arp.cpp
$NDK_PATH/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/x86_64-linux-android29-clang++ -static -o assets/arp.x86_64 src/arp.cpp


# NDK_PATH example: "NDK_PATH=/home/ubuntu/my-android-toolchain"
```

### Building the APK
```bash
cd deadnet/apk
buildozer android debug # build in debug mode
```

# Notes
### Permissions
* Some parts were compiled into native binaries due to lack of permissions to open raw sockets by the Python interpreter on Android (even when root)
* `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission is requested in order to access the SSID (wifi network name)
